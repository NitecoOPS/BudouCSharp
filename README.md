# BudouCSharp
Port from Python

I want to share my exprerience about Nature Language Processing ...

Hey! Don't think about AI or decesion tree ... No no, just a small C# port for:

1. Budou (https://github.com/google/budou)
2. Google NLP API (https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/)
3. Wrap all under DB storage (EF custom table) and of course is great caching layer of EPiServer (Johan Björnfot: https://world.episerver.com/blogs/Johan-Bjornfot/Dates1/2018/5/iobjectinstancecache-readthrough/) (will available soon via nuget package)

### It's for someone want to have better words wrap for CJK (China, Japanese, Korean) languages on your website.
1. Register Google NLP
2. Export credential 
3. Play with my simple project (cmd) in attachment.

Happy Coding! :)
P.S: Nuget link will be update soon for you.
