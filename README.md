# BudouCSharp
Port from Python
---
I want to share my exprerience about Nature Language Processing ...

Hey! Don't think about AI or decesion tree ... No no, just a small C# port for:

Budou (https://github.com/google/budou)
Google NLP API (https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/)
And wrap all under DB storage (EF custom table) and of course is great caching layer of EPiServer (Johan Björnfot: https://world.episerver.com/blogs/Johan-Bjornfot/Dates1/2018/5/iobjectinstancecache-readthrough/) (will available soon via nuget package)

It's for someone want to have better words wrap for CJK (China, Japanese, Korean) languages on your website.

Step 1: Register Google NLP
Step 2: Export credential 
Step 3: Play with my simple project (cmd) in attachment.

P.S: Nuget link will be update soon for you :) (could we have some comments to encorage me?)
